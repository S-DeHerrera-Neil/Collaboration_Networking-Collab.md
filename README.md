## Objectives

1. Write a Python program that creates a TCP server and listens for incoming connections on a specific port. Once a connection is established, the server should receive and display the data sent by the client.

2. Implement a Python program that acts as a TCP client and connects to a remote server on a specified IP address and port. The client should send a message to the server and display the response received.

3. Create a Python program that simulates a simple chat application using sockets. The program should allow multiple clients to connect to a server and exchange messages with each other.

4. Develop a Python program that performs basic file transfer over a TCP connection. The program should allow a client to send a file to a server, and the server should save the received file to disk.

Remember to handle error cases and consider security aspects when implementing these prompts. Happy coding!
